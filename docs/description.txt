Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC): transport layer protocol, built-in TLS, used by HTTP/3.

Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS): TLS on UDP, real-time.

Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC): authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol.

Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE): protocol to d to protect CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) messages using end-to-end encryption.

mbedTLS (formerly PolarSSL): TLS/SSL customized for IoT.

wolfSSL: TLS/SSL for IoT.

Real-Time Operating System (RTOS).

Quick EMUlator (QEMU): emulator and virtualizer, emulates boards like Raspberry Pi, STM32.

simavr: AVR microcontroller simulator.

OpenIoT-SDK: SDK for Cortex-M.

Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR):  binary serialization format for IoT.

Protocol Buffers (Protobuf): language-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data, Strongly typed.

MessagePack: binary serialization format. 

gRPC-lite: lightweight Protobufâ€‘Lite runtime with gRPC.

Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF): Official open-source SDK expressif.

FreeRTOS: real-time operating system (RTOS) kernel. 

PlatformIO: cross-platform build system and IDE extension for IoT.

Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM): combination of AES for confidentiality and 
Galois field multiplication (GMAC) for authentication and integrity. 

esp-Mesh: Wi-Fi-based mesh networking protocol for ESP32/ESP8266.

gRPC: RPC for Protocol Buffers (protobuf).

Interface Definition Language (IDL): specification language used to describe the interfaces
that software components expose;  It provides a language-agnostic way to define data types, 
service methods, and APIs,  which can then be automatically translated into code 
(stubs/skeletons) in multiple programming languages.
