# IoT-mesh
A network protocol that allows various IoT devices with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities to communicate and form a mesh

### Purpose
Due to limited processoing power and memory capacity of IoT devices, present network protocols and network protocol implementations are not suitable for IoT devices. This project aims to customize present network protocols and their implementation to be more IoT-friendly. Non-critical components of network protocols are stripped off to ease the constraint on IoT devices' hardware. This endeavour includes but is not limited to:
1. Implementing a reliable network connection similar to TCP, but more customized towards IoT devices.
2. Enforcing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation smiliar to SSL, but more customized towards IoT devices. 
3. IoT network mesh utilizing a combination of Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11.
4. IoT hardware virtualization so PCs can run an IoT emulator appearing as a regular IoT devices to other IoT devices in the network mesh. 
5. A mechanism for IoT devices to share the various types data generated by IoT sensors, e.g., tempature sensor readings, flame sensor readings, PIR sensor readings, etc. 
6. C compiler optimized for IoT devices' processors.
8. Delegating tasks requiring significant processing power and memory capacity to PCs.
